**User:** I canceled my order last week but I still got charged and the order still shows active in my account.
**Agent:** I understand you're concerned about being charged for a canceled order that still appears active. I can certainly help you with this billing matter.

To investigate this for you, could you please provide me with your order number? Once I have that, I can:

*   **Review your order status:** I will verify if the cancellation was successfully processed on our end.
*   **Check for charges:** I will confirm if the charge was indeed applied and understand why it might have occurred.
*   **Initiate a refund if necessary:** If the charge was made in error, I will process a refund for you.

Please provide your order number so I can assist you further.

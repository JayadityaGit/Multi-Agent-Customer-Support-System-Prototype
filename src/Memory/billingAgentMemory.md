**User:** Users are facing issues where orders are placed successfully, but billing shows incorrect charges or payment failures due to technical errors during checkout
**Agent:** I understand you're experiencing issues with incorrect charges or payment failures during checkout, even when orders are placed successfully. I can certainly help you with the billing aspects of this.

To clarify, are you inquiring about:

*   **Explaining the incorrect charges** that users are seeing on their bills?
*   **Investigating payment failures** that are being reported?
*   **Issuing refunds** for any incorrect charges that have already been applied?
*   **Updating payment methods** that might be contributing to these issues?

Please let me know which of these billing-related areas you'd like assistance with, and I'll do my best to resolve it for you.
